							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The use of deprecated or obsolete functions could indicate neglected code.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  As programming languages evolve, functions occasionally become obsolete due to:<br><br>- Advances in the language.<br><br>- Improved understanding of how operations should be performed effectively and securely.<br><br>- Changes in the conventions that govern certain operations.<br><br>Functions that are removed are usually replaced by newer counterparts that perform the same task in some different and hopefully improved way. <br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code uses the deprecated function <code>getpw()</code> to verify that a plaintext password matches a user's encrypted password. If the password is valid, the function sets <code>result</code> to 1; otherwise it is set to 0. <br><br><pre><br>	...<br>	getpw(uid, pwdline); 	<br>	for (i=0; i&lt;3; i++){<br>	cryptpw=strtok(pwdline, ":");<br>		pwdline=0;<br>	}<br>result = strcmp(crypt(plainpw,cryptpw), cryptpw) == 0;<br>	...<br></pre><br><br>Although the code often behaves correctly, using the <code>getpw(</code>) function can be problematic from a security standpoint, because it can overflow the buffer passed to its second parameter. Because of this vulnerability, <code>getpw()</code> has been supplanted by <code>getpwuid()</code>, which performs the same lookup as <code>getpw()</code> but returns a pointer to a statically-allocated structure to mitigate the risk.<br><br>Not all functions are deprecated or replaced because they pose a security risk. However, the presence of an obsolete function often indicates that the surrounding code has been neglected and may be in a state of disrepair. Software security has not been a priority, or even a consideration, for very long. If the program uses deprecated or obsolete functions, it raises the probability that there are security problems lurking nearby.
