							<p>
							  Failing to explicitly handle SSL exceptions can cause the application to overlook unexpected states and conditions.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Unhandled SSL exception vulnerabilities occur when:<br><br>1.	An SSL-specific exception is thrown.<br><br>2.	The exception is not explicitly handled. <br><br>The SSL-specific exceptions <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException</code>, <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLKeyException</code>, and <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException</code> all convey important errors related to an SSL connection. If these errors are not explicitly handled, the connection can be left in an unexpected and potential insecure state. <br><br>Just about every serious attack on a software system begins with the violation of a programmer's assumptions. After the attack, the programmer's assumptions seem flimsy and poorly founded, but before an attack many programmers would defend their assumptions well past the end of their lunch break.<br><br>Two dubious assumptions that are easy to spot in code are "this operation can never fail" and "it doesn't matter if this operation fails". When a programmer fails to catch an exception that an operation may throw, they implicitly state that they are operating under one of these assumptions.
