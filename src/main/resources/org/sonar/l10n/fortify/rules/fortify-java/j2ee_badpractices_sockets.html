							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Socket-based communication in web applications is prone to error.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The J2EE standard permits the use of sockets only for the purpose of communication with legacy systems when no higher-level protocol is available. Authoring your own communication protocol requires wrestling with difficult security issues, including: <br><br>- In-band versus out-of-band signaling<br><br>- Compatibility between protocol versions<br><br>- Channel security<br><br>- Error handling<br><br>- Network constraints (firewalls)<br><br>- Session management<br><br>Without significant scrutiny by a security expert, chances are good that a custom communication protocol will suffer from security problems.<br><br>Many of the same issues apply to a custom implementation of a standard protocol. While there are usually more resources available that address security concerns related to implementing a standard protocol, these resources are also available to attackers.
