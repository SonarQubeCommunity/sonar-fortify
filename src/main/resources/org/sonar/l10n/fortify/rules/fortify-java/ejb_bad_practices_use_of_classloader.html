							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The program violates the Enterprise JavaBeans specification by using the class loader.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container [1]. <br><br>In this case, the program violates the following EJB guideline:<br><br>"The enterprise bean must not attempt to create a class loader; obtain the current class loader; set the context class loader; set security manager; create a new security manager; stop the JVM; or change the input, output, and error streams."<br><br>A requirement that the specification justifies in the following way: <br><br>"These functions are reserved for the EJB container. Allowing the enterprise bean to use these functions could compromise security and decrease the container's ability to properly manage the runtime environment."
