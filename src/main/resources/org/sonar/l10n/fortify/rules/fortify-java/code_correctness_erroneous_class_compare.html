							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Determining an object's type based on its class name can lead to unexpected behavior or allow an attacker to inject a malicious class.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Attackers may deliberately duplicate class names in order to cause a program to execute malicious code. For this reason, class names are not good type identifiers and should not be used as the basis for granting trust to a given object. <br><br>Example 1: The following code opts to trust or distrust input from an <code>inputReader</code> object based on its class name. If an attacker is able to supply an implementation of <code>inputReader</code> that executes malicious commands, this code will be unable to differentiate the benign and malicious versions of the object. <br><br><pre><br>if (inputReader.getClass().getName().equals("TrustedName"))<br>{<br>   input = inputReader.getInput();<br>   ...<br>}<br></pre>
