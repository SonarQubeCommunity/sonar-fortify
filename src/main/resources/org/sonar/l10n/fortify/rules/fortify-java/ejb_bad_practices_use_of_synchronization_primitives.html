							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The program violates the Enterprise JavaBeans specification by using thread synchronization primitives.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container [1]. <br><br>In this case, the program violates the following EJB guideline:<br><br>"An enterprise bean must not use thread synchronization primitives to synchronize execution of multiple instances."<br><br>A requirement that the specification justifies in the following way: <br><br>"This rule is required to ensure consistent runtime semantics because while some EJB containers may use a single JVM to execute all enterprise bean's instances, others may distribute the instances across multiple JVMs."
