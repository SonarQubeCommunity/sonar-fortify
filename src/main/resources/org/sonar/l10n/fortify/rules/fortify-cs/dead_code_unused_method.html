							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  This method is not reachable from any method outside the class.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  This method is never called or is only called from other dead code. Dead code is defined as code that is never directly or indirectly executed by a public method.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> In the following class, the method <code>DoWork()</code> can never be called.<br><br><pre><br>public class Dead {<br>  private void DoWork() {<br>    Console.Write("doing work");<br>  }<br>  public static void Main(string[] args) {<br>    Console.Write("running Dead");<br>  }<br>}<br></pre><br><br><b>Example 2:</b> In the following class, two private methods call each other, but since neither one is ever invoked from anywhere else, they are both dead code.<br><br><pre><br>public class DoubleDead {<br>  private void DoTweedledee() {<br>    DoTweedledumb();<br>  }<br>  private void DoTweedledumb() {<br>    DoTweedledee();<br>  }<br>  public static void Main(string[] args) {<br>    Console.Write("running DoubleDead");<br>  }<br>}<br></pre><br><br>(In this case it is a good thing that the methods are dead: invoking either one would cause an infinite loop.)
