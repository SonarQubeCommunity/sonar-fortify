							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The <code>ICloneable</code> interface specifies a weak contract for its <code>Clone</code> method and should be avoided.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The <code>ICloneable</code> interface does not guarantee deep cloning, classes that implement it may not behave as expected when they are cloned. Classes that implement <code>ICloneable</code> and perform only shallow-cloning (copies only the object, which includes existing references to other objects) may result in unexpected behavior. Because deep-cloning (copies the object and all referenced objects) is typically the assumed behavior of a clone method, the use of the <code>ICloneable</code> interface is error prone and should be avoided.
