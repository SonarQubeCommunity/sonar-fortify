							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The program defines an overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Prior to HTML5, Web browsers enforced the Same Origin Policy which ensures that in order for JavaScript to access the contents of a Web page, both the JavaScript and the Web page must originate from the same domain. Without the Same Origin Policy, a malicious website could serve up JavaScript that loads sensitive information from other websites using a client's credentials, culls through it, and communicates it back to the attacker. HTML5 makes it possible for JavaScript to access data across domains if a new HTTP header called <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> is defined. With this header, a Web server defines which other domains are allowed to access its domain using cross-origin requests. However, caution should be taken when defining the header because an overly permissive CORS policy will allow a malicious application to communicate with the victim application in an inappropriate way, leading to spoofing, data theft, relay and other attacks.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> Below is an example of using a wildcard to programmatically specify which domains the application is allowed to communicate with.<br><br><pre><br>  response.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");<br></pre><br><br>Using the <code>*</code> as the value of the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header indicates that the appliction's data is accessible to JavaScript running on any domain.<br>
