							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The program violates the Enterprise JavaBeans specification by using the <code>java.io</code> package.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container [1]. <br><br>In this case, the program violates the following EJB guideline:<br><br>"An enterprise bean must not use the java.io package to attempt to access files and directories in the file system."<br><br>A requirement that the specification justifies in the following way: <br><br>"The file system APIs are not well-suited for business components to access data. Business components should use a resource manager API, such as JDBC, to store data."
