							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  This class overrides only one of <code>Equals()</code> and <code>GetHashCode()</code>.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  .NET objects are expected to obey a number of invariants related to equality. One of these invariants is that equal objects must have equal hashcodes. In other words, if <code>a.Equals(b) == true</code> then <code>a.GetHashCode() == b.GetHashCode()</code>. <br><br>Failure to uphold this invariant is likely to cause trouble if objects of this class are stored in a collection. If the objects of the class in question are used as a key in a Hashtable or if they are inserted into a Dictionary, it is critical that equal objects have equal hashcodes.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following class overrides <code>Equals()</code> but not <code>GetHashCode()</code>.<br><br><pre><br>public class Halfway() {<br>  public override boolean Equals(object obj) {<br>    ...<br>  }<br>}<br></pre>
