							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The function is declared to return an unsigned number but returns a signed value.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  It is dangerous to rely on implicit casts between signed and unsigned numbers because the result can take on an unexpected value and violate weak assumptions made elsewhere in the program. <br><br><b>Example:</b> In this example, depending on the return value of <code>accecssmainframe()</code>, the variable <code>amount</code> can hold a negative value when it is returned. Because the function is declared to return an unsigned value, <code>amount</code> will be implicitly cast to an unsigned number. <br><br><pre><br>unsigned int readdata () {<br>	int amount = 0; <br>...<br>amount = accessmainframe(); <br>...<br>	return amount;<br>}<br></pre><br><br>If the return value of <code>accessmainframe()</code> is -1, then the return value of <code>readdata()</code> will be 4,294,967,295 on a system that uses 32-bit integers.<br><br>Conversion between signed and unsigned values can lead to a variety of errors, but from a security standpoint is most commonly associated with integer overflow and buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
