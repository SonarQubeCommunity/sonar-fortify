							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The program violates the Enterprise JavaBeans specification by using sockets.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container [1]. <br><br>In this case, the program violates the following EJB guideline:<br><br>"An enterprise bean must not attempt to listen on a socket, accept connections on a socket, or use a socket for multicast."<br><br>A requirement that the specification justifies in the following way: <br><br>"The EJB architecture allows an enterprise bean instance to be a network socket client, but it does not allow it to be a network server. Allowing the instance to become a network server would conflict with the basic function of the enterprise bean-- to serve the EJB clients."
